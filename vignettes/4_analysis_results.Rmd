`RiTMIC` (**R**egulat**I**on of **T**umor **MI**croenvironment **C**omposition) is an open-access R package to study the link between the gene expression in a tumor and the microenvironment composition.  

![](images/pipeline_ritmic.png)

The pipeline is in 4 steps:  

1. **Deconvolution** of the bulk samples to obtain the cell type composition.
2. **Extraction** of the cancer expression.
3. **Differential** analysis of the gene expression in the cancer component.
4. **Analyze** of the link between the gene expression in the cancer and the tumor composition.

This vignette allows to apply the **step 4**, the step of analysing of the link between the gene expression in the cancer and the tumor composition.


# Load data and pretreatment 

`A_calc` is the matrix of cell type proportion, obtained in the vignette 1_deconvolution.Rmd.  
$D_{cancer}$ is the matrix with the gene expression of cancer cells in each sample, obtained in the vignette 2_identification_extraction_tumor_expression.Rmd.  

`res_penda` are the results of the gene expression differential analysis obtained in the vignette 3_penda_analysis.

The function `Ritmic::pre_treat` reformats the Penda results and sorts them to conserve genes with more than `thres_p` samples deregulated and not deregulated.

```{r, label="load_data"}
A_calc = readRDS("data_example/res_edec.rds")$A
colnames(A_calc) = seq(ncol(A_calc))
D_cancer = readRDS("data_example/D_cancer_pretreat.rds")
res_penda = readRDS("data_example/penda_res.rds")

res_penda_pretreat = Ritmic::pre_treat_Penda(penda_res = res_penda, thres_p = 5)
```

# Compute metrics

For each gene, the function `calc_dist` makes two groups according to the deregulation status. Then, it computes for each cell type different metrics to evaluate the distance between the two groups of cell proportions. An important distance suggests a link between the gene expression and the cell type proportion.  

The function `calc_corr` compute the correlation between the gene expression in bulk samples and the micro-environment proportion.  

```{r, label="compute metrics "}
res_dereg <- Ritmic::calc_dist(binary_penda = res_penda_pretreat, A = A_calc[, colnames(res_penda_pretreat)])
res_corr <- Ritmic::calc_corr(D_cancer = D_cancer, A = A_calc[, colnames(D_cancer)])
```

# Analyze

Now, we can look at the link between each gene expression and the microenvironment composition. 
For example, we can take the cell-type 3.

```{r, label="res"}
summary(res_dereg[res_dereg$type == 3, ])

res_dereg$genes[which.max(res_dereg[res_dereg$type == 3, "kanto"])]
res_dereg$genes[which.max(res_dereg[res_dereg$type == 3, "ks_d"])]
res_dereg$genes[which.max(res_dereg[res_dereg$type == 3, "st_st"])]

```

Here we can see that for the Kantorovitch metric it's the expression of the gene "PDE4B" which is the more linked with the cell type 3 proportion. For Kolmogorov-smirnov and Student it's the gene "MCC".

```{r, label="MCC"}
df = data.frame(expr = D_cancer["MCC", ],
           prop_3 = A_calc[3, colnames(res_penda_pretreat)],
           penda = as.factor(res_penda_pretreat["MCC", ]))

ggplot(df, aes(x = expr, y = prop_3, color = penda)) + 
  geom_point() + theme_minimal(base_size = 14)
```

Whe, we look at this gene expression depending of the proportion of the cell type 3, we can see than the gene seems overexpressed only in samples with less than 0.2 of the type 3.
