\title{Simulation of new tumors RNAseq profiles based on already known tumors expression (T cancer).}
\usage{
simu_T_cancer(tumor_RNAseq, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{tumor_RNAseq}{The matrix of gene expression for the already known tumors samples.}

\item{n}{Total number of tumors.}
}
\value{
This function return a matrix of size n*p with a different gene 
expression profile for each tumor.
}
\description{
\code{simu_T_cancer} generates a \strong{gene expression} matrix, with a different
expression for each of the \strong{n} tumors. \cr 
Matrix dimensions : n*p
}
\details{
Genes names are imported from the tumor_RNAseq data \cr
 Bimodal distribution of each gene expression is infered with the
 \code{\link[mixtools]{normalmixEM}} function \cr 
 When the bimodal distribution doesn't work (too many 0, extreme value, etc.), 
 the gene expression is sampled from existing values.
