\title{Pre-treatment of the Penda results}
\usage{
pre_treat(penda_res, thres_p)
}
\arguments{
\item{penda_res}{List of two matrices, $up_genes and $down_genes with 
1 or 0 for each gene and each sample obtained by the Penda method. 
See: \code{\link[penda]{penda_test}}}

\item{thres_p}{Minimal number of samples in each deregulation group to 
conserved the gene.}
}
\value{
A binary matrix of deregulation 0/1 with the genes that can be used 
 for the statistical analysis and their status for each sample.
}
\description{
\code{pre_treat} takes as input the Penda result lists and 
combines them to make only one matrix of size genes*samples, with 1 for 
deregulated genes and 0 for conserved genes. Then, the matrix is sorted to 
conserved only the genes with a different deregulation status in more than 
thres_p samples.
