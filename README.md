# Ritmic
**Ritmic**, for RegulatIon of Tumor MIcroenvironment Composition is an R package to study the link between the gene expression in a tumor and the microenvironment composition. 

The pipeline **Ritmic**  is in 4 steps:

1. **Deconvolution** of the bulk samples to obtain the cell type composition.
2. **Extraction** of the cancer expression.
3. **Differential** analysis of the gene expression in the cancer component.
4. **Analyze** of the link between the gene expression in the cancer and the tumor composition.


# Installation
